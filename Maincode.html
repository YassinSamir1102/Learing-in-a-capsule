        <h6>
            Coding, also known as programming, is the process of creating sets of instructions that computers can
            execute to perform specific tasks. These instructions are written in programming languages, which consist of
            syntax and rules that govern how code is structured and executed. Coders write code to develop software
            applications, websites, mobile apps, games, and more.

            Coding involves problem-solving and logical thinking, as programmers need to break down complex tasks into
            smaller, manageable steps that a computer can understand and execute. It requires attention to detail and
            precision, as even small errors in code can lead to unexpected outcomes or failures.

            There are many programming languages, each with its own syntax and purpose. Some popular programming
            languages include Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and Ruby, among others. Programmers often specialize in one
            or more languages based on their interests, career goals, and the requirements of the projects they work on.

            In summary, coding is the process of writing instructions in a programming language to create software and
            applications that solve problems, automate tasks, and enable technology to perform a wide range of
            functions.
