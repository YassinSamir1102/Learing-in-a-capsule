                                Definition of Friction Force:
                                Friction force is a resistive force that occurs when two surfaces interact, opposing the
                                relative motion or attempted motion between them.
                            </li>

                                <br>
                                Static Friction: Prevents motion between two surfaces that are not moving relative to
                                each other. It must be overcome to start moving.
                                <br>
                                Kinetic (Sliding) Friction: Acts on objects that are sliding over a surface.
                                Rolling Friction: Occurs when an object rolls over a surface.
                                <br>
                                Fluid Friction (Drag): Resistance by fluids (liquids or gases) against an object's
                                motion through the fluid.
                            </li>

                                <br>
                                Surface Roughness: Rougher surfaces generally have higher friction.
                                <br>
                                Normal Force: The perpendicular force exerted by a surface on an object; greater normal
                                force increases friction.
                                <br>
                                Material Properties: Different materials have different frictional properties
                                (coefficients of friction).
                                <br>
                                Presence of Lubricants: Lubricants reduce friction by creating a thin layer between
                                surfaces.

                                Universal: Acts between all masses, regardless of their nature or state.

                                Attractive: Always pulls masses together, never pushes them apart.

                                Inverse Square Law: The force decreases with the square of the distance between the
                                masses. If the distance is doubled, the force is reduced by a factor of four.
                                <br>
                                Vector Quantity: Has both magnitude and direction. The direction is along the line
                                joining the centers of two masses.

                                Weight: The gravitational force exerted by Earth on an object gives the object its
                                weight.

                                Orbital Motion: Keeps planets in orbit around the Sun, moons in orbit around planets,
                                and governs the motion of satellites.
                                <br>
                                Tides: The gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun causes the rise and fall of sea
                                levels on Earth, known as tides.

                                Curvature of Spacetime: Proposes that gravity is not a force but a consequence of the
